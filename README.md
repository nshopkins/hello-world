# hello-world
This is a repository as I follow the github hello-world training documentation. This documentation will walk me  through how to create a repository, start and manage a new branch, make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits, and open and merge a pull request. 


Hello Humans!

My Name is Navar and I have done a bit of coding/scripting and I have enjoyed it so far. At this point I feel that it would be good for me to learn languages in more depth and finally get a GitHub account to host some of my work.
